# Zest Network

## 🌍 What is Zest Network?

Zest Network is a simple, user-friendly way for people in Nigeria to use cryptocurrency, specifically USDC, without needing a wallet app, internet browser, or complicated setups. Whether you have a smartphone or a basic feature phone, Zest lets you send, receive, and check your USDC balance using familiar tools like WhatsApp, SMS, or USSD (those short codes you dial, like \*777#). Our mission is to make decentralized finance (DeFi) accessible to everyone, especially those who’ve never used crypto before, by meeting you where you are—on your phone.

Imagine sending money to a friend, checking your balance, or moving USDC to another blockchain instantly, all through a quick WhatsApp message, SMS, or USSD code, even in areas with limited internet. Zest Network is built to bring financial freedom to Nigeria’s diverse communities, from bustling cities like Lagos to rural villages.

## ✨ What Can You Do with Zest Network?

With Zest Network, you can:

- **Send USDC**: Transfer USDC to anyone in Nigeria using their phone number. For example, send a WhatsApp message like “Send 10 USDC to +234…” or dial a USSD code like `*777*1*10*0803xxx#`.
- **Receive USDC**: Get instant notifications via WhatsApp or SMS when someone sends you USDC, with no app downloads needed.
- **Check Your Balance**: See your USDC balance by sending “Balance” on WhatsApp or dialing `*777*2#` on any phone.
- **Move USDC Across Blockchains**: Seamlessly bridge USDC to other networks like Ethereum or swap it for tokens like USDT, using simple commands like “Bridge 10 USDC to USDT then send 10 to an address.”
- **No Tech Hassle**: No need to manage wallets, seed phrases, or apps. Zest creates and securely manages a wallet for you when you start using it.

## 🌐 How Interoperability Works with Zest

**Interoperability** means different blockchain networks can “talk” to each other, letting you move money or data across them—like sending USDC from one blockchain to another. In DeFi, this is key because crypto assets and services are spread across multiple networks (e.g., Morph Mantle, Ethereum, Polygon), and users need a way to access them without getting stuck on one chain.

Zest Network makes interoperability seamless by:

- **Bridging Made Easy**: Want to move 10 USDC from Zest’s home network (Morph or Mantle) to Ethereum? Just send a WhatsApp message like “Bridge 10 USDC to USDT.” Zest uses advanced tools (Hyperlane and LI.FI) to find the fastest, cheapest way to move your money across chains, so you don’t need to understand the tech.
- **Smooth Follow-Up Actions**: After bridging, you can do more, like sending tokens to another address on the new chain. For example, “Bridge 10 USDC to USDT then send 10 to 0x123…” triggers both steps automatically, with Zest coordinating everything behind the scenes.
- **No Extra Steps for Users**: You don’t need to switch apps, manage multiple wallets, or learn blockchain jargon. Zest handles the complex process of moving assets and data across networks, delivering simple confirmations via WhatsApp, SMS, or USSD.
- **Affordable and Fast**: Zest optimizes cross-chain transfers to keep fees low (covered by a 1% fee on transactions) and ensures quick processing, so you can move money in seconds, even on a feature phone with no internet.

By combining Hyperlane (for sending instructions across blockchains) and LI.FI (for moving assets efficiently), Zest Network makes it feel like all blockchains are one, letting you focus on using your money, not navigating tech.

## 📱 How It Works
